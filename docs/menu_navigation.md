On some boards ESC and F1 are mapped to buttons on the PCB.

TODO talk about :-
* Cursor keys
* Enter - to select an entry
* Press a single letter - to match the start of a name
* Deleting files
* Renaming files
* Copying files

TODO :- Explain both are a compromise:
* Sync to monitor
* Sync to CPU cycles

#### Loading from tape
TODO :- Explain order of 
* Set Spectrum loading
* Choose a tape
* Change CPU speed to make it faster

TODO :- Explain that sometimes speeding it up makes it crash at the end if you are syncing with your monitor. Too many CPU cycles between frames.
